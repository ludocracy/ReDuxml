class Logic
operator hash
dependencies?
	e.g. arithmetic requires boolean, string requires arithmetic

boolean:
? :
==
!=
&&
||
!

arithmetic (subset of maths):
+
-
*
/
**
>
>=
<
<=
==
!=

maths:
basically everything in Math

string:
everything in String

functions:
any method defined in this logic

any method that operates on ANY macro string term must use Base_types::Operators
"use" means: ask logics and get either nil or proc/symbol/inverse/etc;
so even if a given method would normally return a value, if it's not in the logics, you just get nil

later, when hardening code, look at Parser gem; it's too big for our purposes, but Dentaku is too small.
