# Plop
Plop is an open-source, universal configuration management system for technical designers,
that allows the creation of dynamic technical designs, capturing intent, not behavior.

This is achieved through a simple parameterization scheme for XML, bound to a Ruby model
allowing real-time continuous integration for hardware design just as in software.
