# components consist of components and never overlap. therefore a general tree.rb structure is perfect
# for representing component structures and also works perfectly with XML
# however, DesignOS needs to be able to traverse concreteward and abstractward
# and there are up to as many of each as there are views; change timestamps are a view (concrete if after a change, abstract if before);
# for example: when a parameter is set, the resulting design is a concrete child
# if that parameter value is overridden by a subtemplate, that produces a concrete grandchild
# therefore, every node in this new type of tree.rb is also a member of a hash of arrays - one hash for each query, and
# view hashes are only constructed upon query except for those needed by DesignOS to perform
#
# changes made to Components are made to both the XML node and data node simultaneously
# in order to provide real-time feedback to XML editor
# could add switch to turn this off
