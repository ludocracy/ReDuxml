#the component is the base of every object in DesignOS and any designs produced in it.
#components consist of components and never overlap. therefore a general tree structure is perfect
#for representing component structures and also works perfectly with XML
#however, DesignOS needs to be able to traverse concreteward and abstractward
#and there are up to as many of each as there are views; change timestamps are a view (concrete if after a change, abstract if before);
#for example: when a parameter is set, the resulting design is a concrete child
#if that parameter value is overridden by a subtemplate, that produces a concrete grandchild
#therefore, every node in this new type of tree is also a member of a hash of arrays - one hash for each query, and
#view hashes are only constructed upon query except for those needed by DesignOS to perform
#
#changes made to Components are made to both the XML node and data node simultaneously
#in order to provide real-time feedback to XML editor
#could add switch to turn this off
